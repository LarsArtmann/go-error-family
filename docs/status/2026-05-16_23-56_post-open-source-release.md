# Status Report — 2026-05-16 23:56

**Post-Open-Source-Release Status** | v0.1.1 | MIT License | Public Repo

---

## Executive Summary

go-error-family is now a public, MIT-licensed Go library. The core protocol (Family classification, error construction, CLI boundary handling, diagnostic rules, debug agent) is **fully implemented and tested**. Tonight's session completed the README rewrite (fixing fabricated API docs), switched to MIT, updated the changelog, and tagged v0.1.1. The library is in a **shippable state** with clean `go vet`, race-free tests, and 90.8% root package coverage.

## b) PARTIALLY DONE 🔶

| Item | Status | What's Missing |
|------|--------|----------------|
| Diagnostic test coverage | 🔶 59.5% | Rules that shell out (`pg_isready`, `git`, DNS lookups) are integration-test territory. `GitRule.Run` at 17.3%, `PostgresRule.Run` at 35.5%, `FilesystemRule.Run` at 47.5% |
| `RegisterTemplate` coverage | 🔶 0% | Exported function with zero test coverage — only `lookupTemplate` is tested indirectly |
| `formatWhy` / `suggestFix` | 🔶 50% | Some family branches untested (likely Corruption, Infrastructure paths) |
| `Family.Audience()` | 🔶 80% | Missing test for default/invalid family branch |
| `Family.DefaultMessage()` | 🔶 66.7% | Missing test for invalid family branch |
| `Family.Tone()` | 🔶 66.7% | Missing test for invalid family branch |
| `suggestStartFix` (postgres) | 🔶 0% | Unexported but part of rule logic, no test at all |

## c) NOT STARTED ⬜

| Item | Priority | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| pkg.go.dev documentation | High | No godoc examples (`func ExampleXxx()`) — pkg.go.dev will render bare signatures |
| Go Report Card integration | Medium | Badge added but no CI to keep it green |
| CI/CD pipeline | High | No GitHub Actions, no automated test/lint on push |
| `report/` package | Unknown | Empty directory exists — purpose unclear |
| Integration tests for diagnostic rules | Medium | Rules that shell out need real-system tests (PostgresRule, GitRule, NetworkRule) |
| API stability guarantees | Medium | No `go vet ./...` in CI, no `golangci-lint` |
| CONTRIBUTING.md | Low | No contributor guide for open-source project |
| Fuzz tests | Low | `ParseFamily`, `Classify`, `applyContext` are fuzzable |
| Benchmarks | Low | No performance benchmarks for hot paths (Classify, HandleError) |
| Versioned module path | Low | Currently `github.com/larsartmann/go-error-family` — no `/v2` convention yet |
| `errors.Join` support | Low | No multi-error classification strategy |
| Changelog automation | Low | Manual CHANGELOG.md updates |

---

## d) TOTALLY FUCKED UP 💥

| Item | Severity | Details |
|------|----------|---------|
| **README had fabricated API docs** | 🔴 Critical (fixed) | AI Agent section documented `Involvement` levels, `ConfirmFunc`, `FixStep.Risk` — **none existed in code**. Fixed in v0.1.1. |
| **Dead link in README** | 🟡 Medium (fixed) | Referenced `docs/2026-05-09_23-30_structured-errors-first-principles-design.md` — file never existed. Removed. |
| **GPG signing broken** | 🟡 Medium | `tag.gpgsign=true` but no secret key — tags require `-c tag.gpgsign=false` workaround |
| **Pre-commit hook not executable** | 🟡 Low | `.git/hooks/pre-commit` exists but isn't executable; git ignores it with a warning |
| **No remote push since v0.1.1** | 🟡 Medium | v0.1.1 tag and 3 commits (README rewrite, license, changelog) are local only — not pushed to origin |
| **docs/ has stale status files** | 🟡 Low | 5 status reports from today alone — could confuse contributors |

---

## e) WHAT WE SHOULD IMPROVE 📈

1. **pkg.go.dev presence** — Add `Example*` test functions so pkg.go.dev renders useful documentation. This is the #1 thing for Go library adoption.
2. **CI pipeline** — GitHub Actions for `go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, and optionally `golangci-lint`. Zero CI for a public library is a trust gap.
3. **Diagnostic rule test coverage** — 59.5% is the weakest spot. Mock the command runner or add integration test tags.
4. **`RegisterTemplate` has 0% coverage** — exported function with zero tests. Trivial to add.
5. **Remove empty `report/` directory** — or document its purpose. Empty dirs in a public repo look unfinished.
6. **Consolidate status docs** — 5 status files from one day is noise. One current status + archive is cleaner.
7. **Fix GPG signing config** — Either add the secret key or set `tag.gpgsign=false` in local config.
8. **Make pre-commit hook executable** — `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit` or remove it.
9. **Add `CONTRIBUTING.md`** — Now that it's public, people need to know how to contribute.
10. **Consider `golangci-lint`** — `go vet` catches little. `golangci-lint` with `revive`, `gocritic`, `gochecknoglobals` would raise the bar.

## g) TOP #1 QUESTION I CANNOT FIGURE OUT MYSELF 🤔

**What is the `report/` directory supposed to be?**

There's an empty `report/` directory at the repo root. It's not referenced in any Go code, any doc, any import, or any test. I cannot tell if it's:

- A planned future package for error reporting (e.g., Sentry integration, structured log output)
- A leftover from an abandoned idea
- Something that should be a sub-package but was never started

This matters because a public library with an empty directory looks unfinished. Either delete it or add a `README.md` inside explaining the intent.
